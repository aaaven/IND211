### What do we do in this module?

----

#### From Physical Computing to Soma Design

#### 2025-2026

----

*Design **Playful Wearables**<!-- .element: class="fragment grow highlight-current-red" --> where Technology Meets the Body.*

Note:
Introduce the module’s essence in one breath.

----

We shift the focus from **Button-press**<!-- .element: class="fragment grow highlight-current-red" --> to **Gestures, Postures, Sensations**<!-- .element: class="fragment grow highlight-current-red" -->. 

----

- Everyday tech reduces us to clicks and swipes.

----

- Our bodies can do much more.

- What about design for/with the whole body? <!-- .element: class="fragment grow highlight-current-red" -->

## Soma Design

Soma design is an approach that foregrounds bodily perception, movement, and sensation throughout the design process, inviting designers to engage somatically with materials and technologies to surface new experiential qualities. 

Note: Emphasize soma design as a shift from symbolic to sensory, experiential design.

#### Why It Matters in Industrial Design?

Designing experiences—not just objects—is at the heart of modern industrial design.  

Note: Tie to HCD research on embodied interaction in product design.


---

### The Framework
#### From Physical Computing to Soma Design
 
- Physical computing gives us the tools  
    - Microcontrollers, sensors, circuits  
- Soma design gives us the awareness
    - Bodily sensation, awareness, reflection

Note:
Explain how soma design (Höök) complements physical prototyping.

---

### The Approach 
#### Exploring Playful Gaming Wearables


- We redesign *Simon Says* as a **situated design experiment**—a shared scaffold for learning.  
- You experiment with new bodily experiences—freely designing wearable controllers that use gesture, posture, and sensation.

Note: Spotlight the pedagogical balance of structure and creativity.

----

### Simon Says

We use the classical yet playful device *Simon Says* as a conceptual platform for investigating the relationship between body, technology, and interaction. It provides a simple but powerful structure.

Note:
We are not designing a new game, but exploring soma design through physical computing.

----

### From Soma Design Perspective

Soma design focuses on the felt experience of the body and invites us to design with, and through, bodily sensation and awareness. Interaction becomes embodied, experiential, and relational.

Note:
Combining soma design with physical computing enables playful, embodied technologies.

----

### New Bodily Interface and Experience

Instead of pressing plastic buttons, your task is to create wearable or sensor-based devices that translate bodily gestures, postures, or sensations into the functions of the original system. This becomes a new form of soma interface design for Simon Says.

## Example: Pacman Live

---

In IND 211, we turn Simon Says into a playful, embodied wearable experience.

## Project Requirements 

- You will **re-imagine the classic game *Simon Says*** using **soma design** + **physical computing**.  
- Instead of pressing buttons, you’ll design **wearable or sensor-based controllers** that use **gestures, postures, or sensations**.  

----

The project is about **learning by making** and combining sensors and circuit with reflection on **bodily interaction**. Your work builds step-by-step and move from **initial concept** → **working prototype** → **integrated embodied experience**.
