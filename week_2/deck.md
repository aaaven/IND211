### Soma Design and Body Map

##### By *Dr. [Aven Le ZHOU](https://www.aven.cc)*, 2025

---

## Why Soma Design?

----

### Interfaces vs. the Body

- Too many interfaces reduce bodily action to **clicks/taps/swipes**<!-- .element: class="highlight-current-yellow" -->  
- The human body can **sense, breathe, tense, relax, move**  
- **How can design engage this richness ?**<!-- .element: class="fragment grow highlight-current-red" -->

----

### Bring **bodily experience** back into design  
- From object-oriented efficiency → **aesthetics of experience**<!-- .element: class="fragment grow highlight-current-red" -->   
- Treat the body not as an I/O device, but as a **lived site of experience**<!-- .element: class="fragment grow highlight-current-red" --> 

---

### A tiny bit Phenomenology

----

#### Corporeality: The Object-Body
- **Material body**: flesh, bone, muscle  
- Narrowed as **mechanical apparatus** in HCI  
- Example: fingers pressing keys; posture as mere constraint

----

#### Embodiment: The Lived-Body
- The body **as experienced from within**  
- Sensation, perception, affect, movement, breath  
- Attending to **felt experience** (tension/ease, warmth/coolness)

----

### Corporeality vs. Embodiment<!-- .element: class="highlight-current-red" --> 
| Aspect | Corporeality (Object-Body) | Embodiment (Lived-Body) |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | Mechanics, measures | Felt experience, awareness |
| Body Role | Data source / actuator | Primary **site** of experience |
| Design Goal | Extract/track/use body or data | Shape bodily **experience** |

---

### Corporeality, Embodiment, and the Self
- Corporeality + embodiment **both matter**  
- Together they underpin higher notions (e.g., **self, awareness**)  
- In soma design: **foreground embodiment** while acknowledging corporeal grounding

---

### Apple Watch Example: Corporeality vs. Embodiment

----

**Corporeality (object-body)**  
- Step count / WeChat Movement ranking  
- Body treated as **mechanical object**  
- Emphasis on **withdrawing/tracking/using data**

----

**Embodiment (lived-body)**  
- Mindfulness app: **Reflect & Breathe**  
- Body treated as **lived experience**  
- Emphasis on cultivating **awareness** (breath, posture, relaxation)

---

## Why this matters:
A seemingly “small” move - look at the body - object → experience **reorients** how we think about and **design with** the body.

---

### Soma = Embodied Experience
- Soma design **foregrounds embodiment**  
- Works with posture, breath, tension, relaxation, movement  
- **Shift:** from body-as-object → **body-as-experience**

---

### Key Features of Soma Design
- **Bodily awareness** & somatic reflection as design material   
- Iterative cycle: **sense → design → re-sense**


---

#### Discussion: Any **Design Examples**<!-- .element: class="fragment grow highlight-current-red" --> ? 

----

#### In-Class Activity (20 mins): 

**Step 1 – Think (2 min)**  
- Individually, pick a design / technology / product / app etc  you use  
- Does it treat your body as **corporeality** or **embodiment**?  

----

**Step 2 – Share (5 min)**  
- In groups of 4, share examples  
- Debate classification; choose **one best example**

----

**Step 3 – Record (3 min)**  
- Post to the correct shared board:  
  - [Corporeality](https://box.xjtlu.edu.cn/f/896d952215ac4b888741/)  
  - [Embodiment](https://box.xjtlu.edu.cn/f/e64393d2e84e402696fb/)

----

**Step 4 – Reflection (10 min)**  
- View the examples together
- Discuss overlaps and differences

---

### Where *Soma Design*<!-- .element: class="fragment grow highlight-current-red" --> Sits in HCI
- Response to limits of usability/metric-driven frames  
- Complements embodied interaction by emphasizing **felt experiences** or **Somaesthetics**  
- Applied in health, wellbeing, learning, art, XR, furniture/wearables

----

### Design Materials (Examples)
- **Breath** (tempo, depth), **muscle tone** (tension/ease)  
- **Posture** (open/closed), **gesture** (expansive/contracted)  
- **Rhythm** (cycles, entrainment), **micro-movements**

----

### Methods (very brief) Overview
- **First-person** inquiry (guided attention, micro-noticing)  
- **Somatic practices** to cultivate sensitivity  
- **Experience prototyping** that invites inward attention

----

### Capturing Somatic Insight
- Short **field notes** (immediate descriptors)  
- **Sensation vocab** (pressure, warmth, flow, weight)  
- **Bodily sketches** and **body maps**

----

## Design Case (For Inspiration)
- A breathing wearable that **pulses with exhale**  
- A chair that **encourages spinal lengthening** via subtle cues  
- A VR scene that **paces** with your diaphragmatic rhythm

----

## Common Pitfalls / Overly Narrowed
- Over-instrumentation that **drowns sensation**  
- Treating the body as **just data**  
- Ignoring diversity of bodies & experiences

----

## Ethics & Inclusion (Brief)
- Bodies differ: histories, abilities, sensitivities  
- Avoid prescriptive “ideal” sensations  
- Invite **agency** and **consentful** attention

---

## Body Mapping 

----

### What Is It?
A technique to **externalize inner bodily experience** by marking sensations on a body outline.

----

### Why Body Mapping?
- Surfaces **tacit** and otherwise invisible experience  
- Helps teams **see patterns** and **design leverage points**  
- Creates a **shared language** for sensation

----

### Materials & Setup
- Printed body outlines (A3/A4) or large paper  
- Pens/markers; color coded and/or with legend  
- Quiet space; 5–15 minutes per mapping

----

#### Body Mapping: Process (1/3)
1) Choose an **activity** or **interaction** (e.g., open the door)  
2) Sit/stand as you normally would; **bring attention inward** close your eye if that helps
3) Slowly perform the activity; **notice** sensations

----

#### Body Mapping: Process (2/3)
4) On the outline, **mark locations** of:  
   - Tension/ease, pressure/contact, warmth/coolness  
   - Breath movement, weight, flow  
5) Add **arrows, textures, words** to describe (qualities)

----

#### Body Mapping: Process (3/3)
6) **Legend** (example):  
   - x pressure, ~ warmth, ⇄ flow, ░ tingling, ↑ breath travel  
7) **Annotate** short labels (2–5 words) for each mark  
8) **Pair/Group reflection**: What patterns emerge?

- [example 02](images/02.jpg)

---

### From Map → Design Insight or Ideas
- **Clusters** of marks = potential design focus  
- Translate qualities into **interaction cues** (e.g., “encourage exhale length”)  
- Ideate **interventions**: rhythms, materials, feedback, timing

---

### Other Example Activities to Map
- “Unlocking phone while walking”  
- “First sip of hot tea”  
- “Waiting screen anxiety”  
- “Deep breath before presenting”

---

### Mini Exercise (In-Class)
**5-10 min:** Map sensations for **Open the Door** or **Unlocking Phone while Walking.**  
- Draw a body shape with two sides if needed
- Mark **pressure**, **breath**, **head/neck posture** (3-5 minutes)
- Pair up and **compare** maps (3-5 minutes)

----

#### Add your bodymap to the shared slides:

- [Open the door](https://box.xjtlu.edu.cn/f/1781c6fafa76452e8d84/)
- [Unlocking Phone while Walking](https://box.xjtlu.edu.cn/f/4c08a83b8c6d4e7fa047/)

----

### 5-10 min: Debrief & Bridge to Prototyping 
- What **surprised** you? What felt **overlooked**?  
- Which sensations would you **support/enhance** or **soften**?  
- After Friday's workshop: connect these insights to **sensors & circuits**

---

### Takeaways
- **Corporeality vs. Embodiment**: both matter; soma design **foregrounds** embodiment  
- Soma design treats **lived bodily experience** as primary  
- **Body mapping** reveals tacit, designable qualities  
- We design **with** and **for** the body 

----

- In considering future design, it is important **not to regard the body solely as a source of data or as a mechanical object**. 

- Rather, the body should be approached as a site of lived experience, with design oriented toward **enriching, enhancing, and guiding bodily experience**, and carrying this perspective into design practice.
